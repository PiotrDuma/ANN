# ANN

Artificial neural networks for image classification based on Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models. Three databases of fruit images are prepared for training and validation datasets, which are improved by white noise and rotation to keep its consistency and increase distinguishability at the same time. The availability of various image descriptors and models allows to study effectiveness and efficiency of neural networks, classification accuracy, and learning process.



## Dataset

There are three different databases containing pictures of fruits:

1. Images of objects in the centre of picture with removed background.

2. Pictures of fruits with complex background. Simple image has only one object in different place. Objects might be deformed due to image resizing and rotating process. 
  source: my own pictures multiplied with image editing 
  
3. Probably the hardsest problem of difficulty level. Images contains any number of fruits located randomply over the picture.
