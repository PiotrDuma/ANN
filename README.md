# ANN
Image classifier implementation based on MLP and CNN networks. Analysing effectiveness and efficiency of networks with different models of descriptors.


DATABASES:
There are three different databases containing pictures of fruits:

1. Images of objects in the centre of picture with removed background.
  source: https://github.com/Horea94/Fruit-Images-Dataset/tree/3571f04df801a3c09c24905f4eccbc159dbab60c/Training

2. Pictures of fruits with complex background. Simple image has only one object in different place. Objects might be deformed due to image resizing and rotating process. 
  source: my own pictures multiplied with image editing 
  
3. Probably the hardsest problem of difficulty level. Images contains any number of fruits located randomply over the picture.
